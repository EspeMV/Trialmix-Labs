# Trialmix Labs

## Description
Trialmix Labs aims to combat the underrepresentation of women and minorities in clinical trials by connecting volunteers and researchers to ensure that these groups are adequately represented. Through Streamlit, our web app is designed to be user-friendly and accessible to all. Whether you're a client searching for a clinical trial of interest or a researcher looking to enhance diversity in your study, our platform streamlines the process. Clients can easily search for trials based on their preferences, while researchers can use the dashboard for personalized suggestions to identify gaps in representation and improve participant recruitment. By fostering these connections, we help ensure that clinical research is more inclusive and reflective of the broader population.

## Future Features
In the future, we hope to implement machine learning algorithms to further enhance the capabilities of our platform. By leveraging predictive models, we aim to provide even more personalized trial recommendations for clients, identifying studies that best align with their unique demographics and health profiles. Additionally, we need to set up the databases to store participant information, clinical trial data, researcher profiles, and analytics, ensuring the system is scalable and secure, with proper encryption to protect sensitive information. We will also work on creating a secure and user-friendly login page, complete with registration, email verification, password recovery, and possibly multi-factor authentication. Implementing OAuth for social login options, such as Google or LinkedIn, is also under consideration to streamline the process for users. Additionally, weâ€™ll focus on finalizing the admin and user portals. The admin portal will manage backend functions like user management, trial approvals, and system monitoring, while the user portal will allow participants to search for trials, view their trial history, and manage their profiles. Over the past weekend, our efforts were concentrated on the researcher portal, which now includes trial management tools, diversity suggestions, and participant engagement features. Moving forward, we will continue to build out and refine the admin and user portals to ensure a seamless and secure experience for all users.
